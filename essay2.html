<h1>Hyperstalgia and &ldquo;Strange Nostalgia&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Lately, when I&rsquo;m finished with work for the day, I unwind by laying in bed and binge-watching SpongeBob<sup>1</sup>. This show is the primary fuel for feeding my nostalgia, with some of my earliest memories consisting of me sitting in front of the television and laughing along to the show&rsquo;s iconic early episodes. (From what my parents have told me, I had already loved the show as a baby, meaning that the little yellow guy has been a part of my life since the very beginning). I am far from the only person my age to feel nostalgia for the show. In fact, nostalgia in general seems to be on the mind of many millennials and gen-Z&rsquo;ers, as seen by the massive popularity of nostalgia<sup>2</sup> compilations<sup>3</sup> on TikTok<sup>4</sup> and other social media sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will not discuss <em>why</em> nostalgia content is popular right now. Instead, I&rsquo;m more interested in the type of media that becomes nostalgic and the intergenerational bridge of shared nostalgia. What do I mean? Well&hellip;</p>
<p>First, back to Spongebob, why is the show so nostalgic? Because the generations that watched the show as kids (or teens) are now becoming adults, right? Yes, but, there are plenty of cartoons released during that time that aren&rsquo;t remembered fondly or remembered at all. One of the things that made the show a widespread and timeless classic, in my opinion, is that the show was inherently nostalgic. Basically, it invoked nostalgic feelings even when its earliest seasons were released. One of the primary inspirations for this essay was this<sup>5</sup> video. The video, whose subject matter is (hopefully) obvious, made me realize that the scenes from the show have a specific quality. Strange, distant, surreal, almost eerie. The show&rsquo;s signature soundtrack, typically consisting of &ldquo;island&rdquo;-style music or old royalty-free music<sup>6</sup>, helps emphasize these qualities.</p>
<p>I would personally describe my early childhood using these same adjectives. Before you become deeply concerned for me, I don&rsquo;t mean that my childhood was unpleasant and terrible. More like, there was this uneasy wonder of being so young and exploring and learning and discovering. The feeling of not being entirely sure what the next adventure would lead to, but always being pleasantly surprised and wanting more. This is likely a big factor in the show's appeal across generations, in addition to older generations appreciating the show&rsquo;s good vibes and wackiness paired with the sharp writing.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Minecraft, another cultural touchstone for millennials and Gen Z, evokes similar feelings. Its dreamy natural landscapes can feel peaceful, uncanny, and lonely, often all at once, directly inspiring memories of those childhood adventures. Serving as a reminder, even for those who did not grow up with the game, of the days of the unknown and the strange and the exciting and the new.</p>
<p>This phenomenon, which I&rsquo;ll refer to as <strong>hyperstalgia</strong>, seems to bridge the gap of nostalgia between generations. Additionally, it expresses nostalgia not as an emotion felt on an individual level with unique personal nostalgic experiences and examples, but as an <em>Idea</em> that connects generations through shared nostalgic experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vaporwave, the most self-consciously <strong>hyperstalgic</strong> artistic movement, fuses old commercials, late 20th-century pop (and funk) music, and retro technology into an intoxicating combination of electronic music, visual aesthetics, and weaponized nostalgia. While the movement is still too young to be considered &ldquo;vintage&rdquo;, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see &ldquo;Vaporwave nostalgia&rdquo; compilations on social media in the 2030s and 2040s.<sup>8</sup> (The song &ldquo;Aquatic Ambience&rdquo; by Scizzie, which is featured in many of the previously mentioned nostalgia compilations, is not a vaporwave track but it shares many of qualities that make vaporwave so nostalgic. So, it&rsquo;s not surprising that this song is featured in so many of these videos.)</p>
<p>Another example is Boomerang<sup>9</sup>, the television network. This channel exclusively plays classic cartoons such as Tom &amp; Jerry, The Jetsons, and The Flintstones. Some of my earliest, most nostalgic, memories involve watching this channel. Being a toddler, laying on the couch with my mom, hearing this<sup>10</sup> bumper theme at 4 in the morning for a few moments as I quickly drifted back into sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comments in these compilations frequently talk about life &ldquo;being so simple back then.&rdquo; While life was definitely <em>easier</em>, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was simple. In fact, the opposite is true. Life is so much more mysterious and exciting as a kid. The colors are brighter, the music sounds better, and the simple rhythms of everyday life are a new adventure. Whereas with adults, the narratives are set and we rationalize our lives and problems into straightforward explanations. (&ldquo;I have to go to work and pay bills because of greedy CEOS/ big government /lizard people etc.)</p>
<p>Nostalgia tends to manifest on two levels:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Individual generations looking back on products, art, and other cultural objects of their youth.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Emotions (youthful optimism, joy, and fun) and sentiments ( youth = simple) that transcend generations and are experienced by most people reminiscing on the past.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea of &ldquo;lost futures&rdquo; is very common in the current discussion around nostalgia. It&rsquo;s the idea that Vaporwave and Retro-futuristic aesthetics are meant to remind us of &ldquo;promised&rdquo; futures taken away from us by the previously mentioned boogiemen of your choice. In this way, nostalgia becomes both a mood and an activity. Traditionalist and revolutionary. Nostalgia is not just vague trips down memory lane. You&rsquo;re now an advocate, an activist. You&rsquo;re tearing the dystopia down, to make way for&hellip; again, that&rsquo;s up to your personal preference, it makes no difference to me, honestly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe nostalgia can be a tool to <em>connect</em> generations instead of pulling them apart (&ldquo;back in my day!&rdquo;-ism), which is desperately needed considering the current<sup>11</sup> tensions<sup>12</sup> between<sup>13</sup> younger and older generations. After all, we grew up with different shows, music, and technology, but the core youthful trials and tribulations are universal. In other words, artistic movements, technology, and pop-culture change, but the experiences and emotions that come along with them transcend generational lines. The popularity of newer art (Spongebob and Minecraft) with older generations, and of older art with younger generations (Boomerang<sup>14</sup> and Looney Tunes<sup>15</sup>), demonstrates this beautifully. Thus, the second manifestation of nostalgia I mentioned tends to be more impactful on an emotional level than the first.</p>
<p>Regardless, I fully expect nostalgia-driven content to continue its rise in popularity. I'm genuinely curious to see what Generation Alpha's nostalgia will look like in the coming years. Will older generations react with confusion, or will they finally recognize the threads connecting their past with the experiences of their children and grandchildren? Ultimately, whether we achieve intergenerational understanding or not, let's all take a break from adulting, &ldquo;legally&rdquo; stream those old Spongebob episodes, and just enjoy the ride.</p>
